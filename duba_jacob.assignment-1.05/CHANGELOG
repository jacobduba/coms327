    Move terrain from chars to enum
    New requirements allow different land types to be repersented by the same icon.
    
    So, terrain is now repersented by enums which I then convert to characters when printing.

    Move to 8 space tabs
    My belief is that 8 space tabs will reduce nesting.
    I have been getting confused by nesting.

    Fix bug causing some times not to be explored
    I'm creating noise on the map by sometimes not exploring with BFS.
    
    However, a tile would remain empty if all four surrounding tiles choose not to explore.
    
    The fix: if not exploring, readd current tile to queue.

    Noise on edges of land types.
    
    Introduced noise on the edges of land to make the
    maps more interesting.
    
    This works by only growing the seed 4/5ths of the time.

Date:   Wed Feb 7 19:06:19 2024 -0600

    Buildings no longer overlap + prevent infinite loop
    So buildings could overlap. So the center could be covered by the pokemart.
    The solution for this was to turn a placement blacklist into a placement whitelist (eg. now buildings must be placed om one of the (5?) land types.
    
    The generator also does not infinite loop if there is not suitable place, like it's all water.

    This commit allows you to place gates at certain coordinates.
    
    If the gate's coordinate is invalid, the gate will not be created.
    A path will not connect to that gate anymore.

    Refactor 2D arrays to as [x][y] instead of [y][x]
    I store coordinates as (x, y).
    I just fixed a bug where I wrote [x][y] instead of [y][x] in 2d arrays.
    So it became clear that coordinates should all follow the same convention.
    So I choose the most popular convention (x, y).

    Got Dijkstra's working!
    
    This is really funny, I had my x and ys mixed up on the loop that initialized the visited 2D array.

    I attempted seeding - giving up.
    
    Seeding would require BFS which uses a queue. C doesn't have built-in support for queues?
    Then laying the path would use Dijkstra's, which uses a heap. C doesn't support that either.
