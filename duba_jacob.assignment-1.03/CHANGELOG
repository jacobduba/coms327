    Buildings no longer overlap + prevent infinite loop
    So buildings could overlap. So the center could be covered by the pokemart.
    The solution for this was to turn a placement blacklist into a placement whitelist (eg. now buildings must be placed om one of the (5?) land types.
    
    The generator also does not infinite loop if there is not suitable place, like it's all water.

    This commit allows you to place gates at certain coordinates.
    
    If the gate's coordinate is invalid, the gate will not be created.
    A path will not connect to that gate anymore.

    Refactor 2D arrays to as [x][y] instead of [y][x]
    I store coordinates as (x, y).
    I just fixed a bug where I wrote [x][y] instead of [y][x] in 2d arrays.
    So it became clear that coordinates should all follow the same convention.
    So I choose the most popular convention (x, y).

    Got Dijkstra's working!
    
    This is really funny, I had my x and ys mixed up on the loop that initialized the visited 2D array.

    Working seed generation

    I attempted seeding - giving up.
    
    Seeding would require BFS which uses a queue. C doesn't have built-in support for queues?
    Then laying the path would use Dijkstra's, which uses a heap. C doesn't support that either.
